# Changelog

All notable changes to Quilon are documented here.

## 0.9.0 — "Stable basics"

The first stabilized release: a small but **verified, runnable** core of the
language. Programs run end-to-end and every example is checked in CI through both
the JIT and native-AOT paths. This is a stable *core*, **not** feature-complete —
see "Known limitations".

### Language

- **Entry point `^`** — `^ = () -> Num => …`. If the body isn't a `Num`, the
  program exits `0` (C `main`-style success), so side-effecting mains need no
  trailing `0`.
- **Modules** — `<< core.io` imports; a `>>` prefix exports a top-level item.
  Built-in `core.io` plus relative/absolute file-path imports.
- **Pipe `|>`** with first-argument injection: `x |> f` ⇒ `f(x)`,
  `x |> f(a)` ⇒ `f(x, a)`.
- **Loops** — `for n <- collection => body` (and `for (n, i) <- collection => body`).
- **`Text`** — a built-in string type (no import): `+` concatenation, `.size`
  (byte length), `.length` (grapheme-cluster count, full UTF-8).
- **`core.io`** — `print(x)` / `eprint(x)` (newline-terminated, over Num/Text/Bool),
  `write(content, fd)`, and `stdout` / `stderr`.
- Numbers (`Num`, f64), `Bool`, arrays (`.size`, indexing), records and named
  record types with methods (implicit `it`), sum types `Ok` / `NotOk` with
  pattern matching, ternary `? :`, blocks `< … >`, recursion, type inference.
- **Memory** — conservative garbage collection (Boehm GC).

### Tooling

- **`quilon run`** — compile and execute in-process via the LLVM JIT.
- **`quilon build [--linker clang|gcc] [-o out]`** — emit a native executable
  (object generated in-process via LLVM `TargetMachine`, linked against the
  bundled `libquilon_rt`).
- **`quilon compile` / `quilon check`** — emit LLVM IR / type-check only.
- **Strict CI** — deny-warnings build, blocking `clippy -D warnings`, `fmt`
  check, and a gate that runs every example through JIT **and** native AOT under
  **both** clang and gcc, asserting matching exit codes.
- Built against **LLVM 22** (inkwell).

### Known limitations (planned for a later release)

- **No generics yet** — `Text` (and other non-numeric values) inside records,
  arrays, or `Ok`/`NotOk` payloads are not supported; numeric payloads work.
- No closures, no `while` loops, no user-defined sum types, no `Unit` type.
- `Text` `.size` works only on identifier receivers in some positions.
- Boehm GC is linked dynamically (`-lgc`); self-contained static GC is planned.
- `argv` is a placeholder.
